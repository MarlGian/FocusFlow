# FocusFlow
focus flow is a pomodoro app with some bugs and background musics

just vibe coded it and took me 3hrs to make it fully functional but has some bugs like

-when the music / bg lofi sound ended it wont loop (my fault, but i aint checking it cuz i already built it when it occurs to me that it has bugs)

-it has modern design tho!!

-settings for dark theme, always on top, enable sounds, reset cycles

-customizations for timer, alarm sound, and 3 lofi background music.

-also it will save the settings you last used!

this is the exe file!

(i debugged, directed and let the ai do the coding but still understand the stuff!!!)
